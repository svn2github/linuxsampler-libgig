/** @brief Serialization / deserialization framework.
 *
 * See class Archive as starting point for how to implement serialization and
 * deserialization with your application.
 *
 * The classes in this namespace allow to serialize and deserialize native
 * C++ objects in a portable, easy and flexible way. Serialization is a
 * technique that allows to transform the current state and data of native
 * (in this case C++) objects into a data stream (including all other objects
 * the "serialized" objects relate to); the data stream may then be sent over
 * "wire" (for example via network connection to another computer, which might
 * also have a different OS, CPU architecture, native memory word size and
 * endian type); and finally the data stream would be "deserialized" on that
 * receiver side, that is transformed again to modify all objects and data
 * structures on receiver side to resemble the objects' state and data as it
 * was originally on sender side.
 *
 * In contrast to many other already existing serialization frameworks, this
 * implementation has a strong focus on robustness regarding long-term changes
 * to the serialized C++ classes of the serialized objects. So even if sender
 * and receiver are using different versions of their serialized/deserialized
 * C++ classes, structures and data types (thus having different data structure
 * layout to a certain extent), this framework aims trying to automatically
 * adapt its serialization and deserialization process in that case so that
 * the deserialized objects on receiver side would still reflect the overall
 * expected states and overall data as intended by the sender. For being able to
 * do so, this framework stores all kind of additional information about each
 * serialized object and each data structure member (for example name of each
 * data structure member, but also the offset of each member within its
 * containing data structure, precise data types, and more).
 *
 * Like most other serialization frameworks, this frameworks does not require a
 * tree-structured layout of the serialized data structures. So it automatically
 * handles also cyclic dependencies between serialized data structures
 * correctly, without i.e. causing endless recursion or redundancy.
 *
 * Additionally this framework also allows partial deserialization. Which means
 * the receiver side may for example decide that it wants to restrict
 * deserialization so that it would only modify certain objects or certain
 * members by the deserialization process, leaving all other ones untouched.
 * So this partial deserialization technique for example allows to implement
 * flexible preset features for applications in a powerful and easy way.

     * When your native C++ objects are serialized, all native data is
     * translated and reflected by such an Object reflection. So each instance
     * of your serialized native C++ class objects become available as an
     * Object, but also each member variable of your C++ objects is translated
     * into an Object, and any other native C/C++ data. So essentially every
     * native data is turned into its own Object and accessible by this API.
     *
     * For each one of those Object reflections, this class provides detailed
     * information about their native origin. For example if an Object
     * represents a native C++ class instante, then it provides access to its
     * C++ class/struct name, to its C++ member variables, its native memory
     * size and much more.
     *
     * Even though this framework allows you to adjust abstract Object instances
     * to a certain extent, most of the methods of this Object class are
     * read-only though and the actual modifyable methods are made available
     * not as part of this Object class, but as part of the Archive class
     * instead. This design decision was made for performance and safety
     * reasons.
     *
     * @see Archive::setIntValue() as an example for modifying Object instances.

    /** @brief Destination container for serialization, and source container for deserialization.
     *
     * This is the main class for implementing serialization and deserialization
     * with your C++ application. This framework does not require a a tree
     * structured layout of your C++ objects being serialized/deserialized, it
     * uses a concept of a "root" object though. So to start serialization
     * construct an empty Archive object and then instruct it to serialize your
     * C++ objects by pointing it to your "root" object:
     * @code
     * Archive a;
     * a.serialize(&myRootObject);
     * @endcode
     * Or if you prefer the look of operator based code:
     * @code
     * Archive a;
     * a << myRootObject;
     * @endcode
     * The Archive object will then serialize all members of the passed C++
     * object, and will recursively serialize all other C++ objects which it
     * contains or points to. So the root object is the starting point for the
     * overall serialization. After the serialize() method returned, you can
     * then access the serialized data stream by calling rawData() and send that
     * data stream over "wire", or store it on disk or whatever you may intend
     * to do with it.
     *
     * Then on receiver side likewise, you create a new Archive object, pass the
     * received data stream i.e. via constructor to the Archive object and call
     * deserialize() by pointing it to the root object on receiver side:
     * @code
     * Archive a(rawDataStream);
     * a.deserialize(&myRootObject);
     * @endcode
     * Or with operator instead:
     * @code
     * Archive a(rawDataStream);
     * a >> myRootObject;
     * @endcode
     * Now this framework automatically handles serialization and
     * deserialization of fundamental data types automatically for you (like
     * i.e. char, int, long int, float, double, etc.). However for your own
     * custom C++ classes and structs you must implement one method which
     * defines which members of your class should actually be serialized and
     * deserialized. That method to be added must have the following signature:
     * @code
     * void serialize(Serialization::Archive* archive);
     * @endcode
     * So let's say you have the following simple data structures:
     * @code
     * struct Foo {
     *     int a;
     *     bool b;
     *     double c;
     * };
     *
     * struct Bar {
     *     char  one;
     *     float two;
     *     Foo   foo1;
     *     Foo*  pFoo2;
     *     Foo*  pFoo3DontTouchMe; // shall not be serialized/deserialized
     * };
     * @endcode
     * So in order to be able to serialize and deserialize objects of those two
     * structures you would first add the mentioned method to each struct
     * definition (i.e. in your header file):
     * @code
     * struct Foo {
     *     int a;
     *     bool b;
     *     double c;
     *
     *     void serialize(Serialization::Archive* archive);
     * };
     *
     * struct Bar {
     *     char  one;
     *     float two;
     *     Foo   foo1;
     *     Foo*  pFoo2;
     *     Foo*  pFoo3DontTouchMe; // shall not be serialized/deserialized
     *
     *     void serialize(Serialization::Archive* archive);
     * };
     * @endcode
     * And then you would implement those two new methods like this (i.e. in
     * your .cpp file):
     * @code
     * #define SRLZ(member) \
     *   archive->serializeMember(*this, member, #member);
     *
     * void Foo::serialize(Serialization::Archive* archive) {
     *     SRLZ(a);
     *     SRLZ(b);
     *     SRLZ(c);
     * }
     *
     * void Bar::serialize(Serialization::Archive* archive) {
     *     SRLZ(one);
     *     SRLZ(two);
     *     SRLZ(foo1);
     *     SRLZ(pFoo2);
     *     // leaving out pFoo3DontTouchMe here
     * }
     * @endcode
     * Now when you serialize such a Bar object, this framework will also
     * automatically serialize the respective Foo object(s) accordingly, also
     * for the pFoo2 pointer for instance (as long as it is not a NULL pointer
     * that is).
     *
     * Note that there is only one method that you need to implement. So the
     * respective serialize() method implementation of your classes/structs are
     * both called for serialization, as well as for deserialization!
     *
     * In case you need to enforce backward incompatiblity for one of your C++
     * classes, you can do so by setting a version and minimum version for your
     * class (see @c setVersion() and @c setMinVersion() for details).

         * incompatible.
         *
         * But also consider the other way around: you might have serialized
         * your latest version of your C++ class, and might deserialize that
         * archive with an older version of your C++ class. In that case it will
         * likewise be checked whether the version of that old C++ class is at
         * least as high as the minimum version set with the already seralized
         * bleeding edge C++ class.
         *
         * Since this Serialization / deserialization framework is designed to
         * be robust on changes to your C++ classes and aims trying to
         * deserialize all your C++ objects correctly even if your C++ classes
         * have seen substantial software changes in the meantime; you might

         * your C++ class or simply changed the order of your members in your
         * C++ class. But what this framework cannot detect is for example if
         * you changed the semantics of the values stored with your members, or
         * even substantially changed the algorithms in your class methods such
         * that they would not handle the data of your C++ members in the same
         * and correct way anymore.

         *
         * Call this method to define a minimum version that your current C++
         * class implementation would be compatible with when it comes to 
         * deserialization of an archive containing an object of your C++ class.
         * Like the version information, the minimum version will also be stored
         * for objects of your C++ class with the resulting archive (and its
         * resulting raw data stream respectively).
         *
         * When you start to constrain version compatibility of your C++ class
         * you usually start by using 1 as version and 1 as minimum version.
         * So it is eligible to set the same number to both version and minimum
         * version. However you must @b not set a minimum version higher than
         * version. Doing so would not raise an exception, but the resulting
         * behavior would be undefined.
         *
         * It is not relevant whether you first set version and then minimum
         * version or vice versa. It is also not relevant when exactly you set
         * those two numbers, even though usually you would set both in your
         * serialize() method implementation.
         *
         * @see @c setVersion() for more details about this overall topic.
         *

         * @param v - the minimum version you want to define for your C++ class
         *            (by default, that is if you do not explicitly call this
         *            method, then a minium version of @c 0 is assumed for your
         *            C++ class instead).
